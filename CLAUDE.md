# Working on this repository

Part of Supertext's "translation plugins for the top 20 open source CMS" project. Each CMS has its own repo named `Supertext/<CMS>-Supertext-Translation`.

## Documentation rule (always)

Every plugin repo keeps three guides, and **every change that affects behaviour, settings, installation or the code structure updates them in the same commit**:

| File | Audience | Must cover |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/INSTALLATION.md` | Administrators | Requirements, install/update/uninstall, API key, language setup, all settings, troubleshooting |
| `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` | Editors | How to translate and review in the CMS's own UI, what is and isn't translated, what errors mean |
| `docs/DEVELOPER.md` | Developers | Architecture, Supertext API protocol, local setup, tests, CI/deploy, releasing, known limitations/roadmap |

Also: `README.md` stays a short overview linking the three guides, and `CHANGELOG.md` gets an entry under *Unreleased* for every user-visible change. Before finishing any task, check the docs still match the code.

## Demo accounts rule (always)

Every demo must be usable right after deployment, without anyone registering in a browser. On **every start**, the demo creates these accounts if they don't exist yet:

| Variables | Account |
| --- | --- |
| `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Full administrator (for Supertext staff) |
| `DEMO_EDITOR_EMAIL`, `DEMO_EDITOR_PASSWORD` | Editor-level account that can translate content in every demo language; used for automated tests and screenshots. Where the CMS has no editor role that works out of the box, use the closest role and document it. |

- Existing accounts are never modified: no password resets from variables, no duplicates on restart.
- A password that doesn't meet the CMS's own password rules skips that account with a clear warning in the log. The demo still starts.
- Values live only in the hosting platform's variables (Railway). Never in the repo, in chat or in logs. Log the variable name, never the password.
- If the CMS has a first-run "create admin" screen, these accounts replace it. Document that once `DEMO_*` is set, the screen no longer appears.
- If a demo already used CMS-specific names (e.g. `TYPO3_ADMIN_*`, `PAYLOAD_ADMIN_*`), keep them as fallbacks for `DEMO_ADMIN_*`.
- The demo also seeds its target languages and at least one sample entry in the source language, and makes sure the editor account can access every target language.
- Document the variables in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` (demo section) and in the demo's `.env.example`.

## Shared Supertext protocol

AI file translation API v1, same as the WordPress plugin: POST HTML file → poll status → GET translation → DELETE. Details in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`. Never commit API keys; use the `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` environment variable or the CMS's settings.

## Strapi specifics

- Before finishing: `npm test`, `npm run test:ts:back`, `npm run test:ts:front`, `npm run build`.
- Test UI changes in `demo/` against the mock (`npm run mock`, `npm run demo:install`, `cd demo && npm run develop`).
- `main` deploys the demo to Railway (project `supertext-cms-demos`, service `Strapi`) via the `Dockerfile`.
